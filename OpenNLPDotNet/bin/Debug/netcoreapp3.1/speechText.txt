Welcome to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee We're glad that you're here I hear an echo First we want Thio Introduce our house Sergeant at arms Nina la J They're back in the corner Uh, Terry McCraw, William More and our Senate Sergeant at arms Michael Caviness Jake Dorian Francis E Want to remind those on WebEx Please mute your mix Thank you.

And Francis Paterson Thank you all for being here and helping us this morning We have ah, big agenda, but a lot of important information today So I want Thio remind everyone Thio keep your questions, uh, succinct and your answers the same So that we can get a lot of information today because we do have a lot of questions and we have a very full agenda So good morning to everyone And I want to introduce my co chair representive Lambeth, and ask if he has any comments thinking about Chairman I would like to make just a couple comments because obviously both of these topics are extremely important for our committee as well as for our citizens across state I do want to thank Secretary and her team I recognize you have a monumental job? Uh, not only today, but these last few years you have had a lot on your plate, and we wanna recognize the work that you and your team are doing for our citizens of the state Uh, we know there are a lot of questions, particularly about the vaccine distribution and when someone might get it.

And we've added that to the agenda so that we can get some of the items in the of the public s so that we can have that discussion and common understanding of where we are today But I think more importantly, understanding of where do we go from here? You know, there was a recent ranking of North Carolina The one I had was ranking us 38th out of 50 states assed faras vaccine distribution And I think it's important for us toe Make sure we understand where we are today, but also lay out the plan of how we're gonna get that up through one of the top levels of distribution and and shots and arms So we look forward to hearing more from you on both topics Transformation office is important topics well, and coming to us, um, common understandings of where we are today And where do we go from here? Thank you Thank you, Chairman Lambeth and I want to echo the comments from my co chair We appreciate the department and Secretary Cohen being with us this morning and giving us this very important update.

So at this time, we will recognize Secretary Cohen from the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Cohen, you're recognized Hello, Chairman Krav Yc, Chairman Lambeth, Everyone who has joined on the committee Thank you so much for the opportunity, I think Well, time to have a conversation on both covitz related topics and on Medicaid transformation on thank you for the opening comments of recognizing that the department has, uh, an incredible girl right now And I am very, uh, grateful for the dedication of the work of my team I know we're going to get into vaccines, but just as a few opening comments to remind folks that while vaccine is certainly the urgency of the moment, you're going to hear how were are working hard on that I want to remind folks that I am also at the point of this pandemic the most worried that I have been for our state in terms of the amount of viral spread that is that is going on in North Carolina Thank you Know, last Saturday we saw, um, cases of 11,500 cases in just 24 hours, and that was following two days of more than 10,000 each day So 10,000, 10,000, 11,000.

It is a lot of virus out there, and then we see from our percent of tests that are positive were in in the teens Um, where I wanna be closer to 5% So we know that there's just a lot of virus here is why I issued are my first secretarial directive, um, to really help outlined for folks, the kinds of actions that could be taken protect themselves Essentially, it boils down to staying home unless you're conducting essential business If you're going to work for some essential business, if you're going to school getting groceries But other than that to really protect ourselves and and again, I know we're going to talk about vaccine, Andi, You know, even if we expended every single vaccine within the next 24 hours, we'll be vaccinating about 5% of our population at that point So we know this is going to take time for us to get vaccine to everyone And in the meantime, we have hard work to dio to protect each other from the worst of this pandemic We know that our hospital systems are strained I know the hospital.

They're gonna be with us talking about vaccine, but they're also working hard Thio manage the high number of covert patients that they're seeing in their doors They are decreasing Non urgent procedure They're moving around staff They're opening up Covad units We've had to open up an ex field hospital in the West Right? So a lot going on to be able to manage this pandemic I'm appreciative of everyone's ongoing partnership as we work through this, because that's the only way we will get through this as a state is through through that collective partnership Thank you, Chairman.

Uh, project Atlantis for allowing Muto open this morning Thank you, Secretary Cohen And again, we thank you and your department for the tough work that you have faced and that is facing you now And we're anxious to hear from you about the Cove in 19 vaccine distribution and such Secretary Cohen, you are recognized again I can't hear you If there was a you are recognized to talk about the distribution of Covert 19 Can you hear me now? Painting when I needed e can't scare you E didn't know if you wanted to move up into the vaccine presentation, but you let me know Yes Please move into the vaccine presentation.

Can you hear me yet? I can I can Thank you You on dso how to go on and my team is going Thio do the slides I want to start by saying, um even today as well go through this We are getting new guidance, new information about the vaccine moment to moment here So I'm going to present the best information I have at the moment But it is It has been quite the challenge, Aziz, we, as you know, from from reading newspaper in terms off Yeah, what exactly is coming to us in terms of number of doses? What is happening related to authorization from the federal government? And you know that that all has contributed thio some of our of our challenges here and so we have a lot of work cut out for us, but I wanted to start with some of the really p important messages that I want, Um, you all to know about the vaccine, and more importantly, for the constituents that you serve We know that these vaccines have been tested in trials with more than 70,000 participants And now we'll talk about the more than 200,000 people in North Carolina that have gotten those vaccines They're tested, they're safe.

And they're effective at preventing COVE in 19 And they are at the core of what will help us get back in control of our lives and back to the people and places the love We know that scientists did have a head start on this, um, that they've been working for many years on the kind of vaccine that we now have on DNA That again that you cannot get coded 19 from the vaccine itself There is no co vid in the in the vaccine Um, and importantly, I'm going to say that so many times supplies are limited I know we're going to talk about how we're ramping up getting the vaccines We have now, but there are a number of counties already that have done a fantastic job Onda have zero vaccine left to give out, and that is our reality that the supplies will be limited Um, but everyone will have a spot to take.

Their shot will go through What? That will that will look like But it will be many, many months until everyone is going to be able to get access to the vaccine Who wants one? All right, let's dive into the to the numbers here As of last evening, our state has administered over 250,000 doses of the vaccine, So 2000, uh, 200,000 Uh, sorry 22,000 57,000 doses administered And so you know that there are two arms of work going on There are vaccines that are getting administrate in the community.

And then there are vaccines that are getting administered through a federal program and partnership with CVS and Walgreens So 219,000 have been administered in the community That's by our hospitals and our local health departments and other vaccine providers And then about 37,992 doses have been administered across about 500 clinics in our long term care facilities already And that's through that partnership with CBS and Walgreens So they've had about 500 clinics in about 38,000 vaccines Uh, so far, what I can say is, I know we all feel a sense of urgency to get out this vaccine quickly I can report that we are getting much faster and much faster, faster That which is great Which is we've we've we're getting, uh we've had 113% increase in vaccinations over the last seven days on DYA can see that in the numbers.

We've had 100,000 doses administered in just the last seven days, So folks are ramping up, but we're going to talk about how to get even faster I want walk you through some of our demographic information, but you can see that white, non Hispanic females are overrepresented some that is some fact that they are overrepresented in our health care workforce But it is something very much we need to be looking out for We know that the folks who are up taking, uh, this vaccine when they're offered are more likely to be white, more likely to be a female, Um, and more likely to be under the age of 50 And again, I think that reflects our health care workforce But as we move into this, I'm gonna talk about equity, um, geographic equity, racial, ethnic, gender, age, equity, all of those pieces as we go through All right, Next life So let's talk about speed, and how do we speed up making sure that we're getting vaccine into arms as quickly as possible? I think it's important The level said About what? How does this process work and how are we working to improve it? Um, so we have had 417,000 doses of vaccine allocated to hospitals and local health department as of last, do you think? And now you heard that there were 257,000 that have been administered So we know that there are, um, places where there is vaccine and we have more to do to get what has been allocated out.

But from the state perspective, we get in that allocation from the federal government, and then we have allocated every single dose out to our vaccine partners Either those partners are in the community like our local health departments or our hospital system Others is that long term care program I mentioned with CVS and Walgreens But all of it is allocated Um, initially, the way we did our allocation prioritization was to make sure that we were getting an equal number of doses per county population We prioritize getting this vaccine into every single county and having at least one if not two access points in every single county And, you know, we have, uh, a very geographically diverse state, a very rural state But we felt it was a priority to get vaccine out everywhere There are some limitations on how the ships that's the vaccine ships in big, big bulk biter ships in 709 175 in a package Madonna in 100.

And the other issue is that once you get it, you can't move it around a lot There are some very specific handling specifications here that does make it difficult to, um, to move around Um, as as I said, the long term care program is working They have 165,000 doses So I mentioned they got 38,000 out But they have 165,000 of our allocation sitting in their bank If you will to continue that that program, we do not intend to allocate further to that program until we see them really working through the allocation that we have given them so far So, um, that has been helpful The fact that we can stop allocating to CVS and Walgreens and focus here on the state, I think is also gonna help So then, when we look at what's happening in our with our vaccine providers across the state, I want to recognize that some are are doing fantastic.

Like I said, some health departments and I want to call out a couple Robinson are Dale Um, they they're doing tremendous work, and they they literally have zero vaccine right now sitting on their shelf Others we know are struggling to get that vaccine out for a variety of reasons Andi, that's what we're trying to tease through And every every county health department Every hospital system that has vaccine has a different reason for what the challenges are We want to make sure we're eliminating any of those challenges and to say, Well, if we can't eliminate those challenges quickly, then way need to either certainly not allocate you anymore But we need you to partner with others and even give that vaccine that you have others who can get it out right now Eso first, we want to make sure we're supporting folks with staffing needs.

So if anyone needs any kind of staffing needs from a vaccinate tour to back off this data entry to answering the phones, we want to do that We we have appreciated so many volunteers have come our way to say, Hey, how can I help? And we are making that those matches right now This is where emergency management Director Spray Berries team is owning that that work for us and and and matching those needs we have We are using the National Guard, um, in some focus vaccine deployments and four sites, um, and Alamance Onda again So we are trying to support with staffing needs and what we have asked all the folks who do have vaccine What is your plan over the next seven days, and how can we help you be successful to get that vaccine out, And then we wanted on board additional providers So we've prioritized on boarding providers that reach our communities that have presence in our communities, particularly historically marginalized communities So we prioritize Our fellow qualified health centers were health centers and community, but but our on boarding vaccine providers all the time Next slide, what we wanted to do.

In addition, as was we, Asai said, Our first couple of a number of weeks, we're prioritizing getting to all 100 counties Then we need to focus on speed So speed comes from being able to get to some high throughput sites, right? So we can get a lot of vaccine out in a period of time And so we have worked with 10 sites, uh, that across our state that have said I can get out vaccine quickly, terrific And we're working with them to allocate mawr vaccine to them to get that higher throughput Thes providers that you see at the top here have committed to us to get about 45,000 plus vaccines out over the next week That is shipment that's coming into them right now Tuesday and Wednesday, just with the shipping cycle times So they will get that shipment and then over the next seven days will be getting them out in these high throughput sites You may have seen that in the news already.

I have seen the ones here in Wake County at Wake Med a Duke and, uh, at U N C On I know that those are being stood up in other places as well I wanted to touch on our vaccine management system This is the computer I T system that helps us know what what is happening and tracking our vaccine deployment I wanna make sure folks know that it isn't It is a new system Our existing state vaccine database was not going to be suitable for a vaccine effort of this scale We were told very early on by our federal partners the kinds of requirements that we would need, and it was very clear that the old apology that we had was not going to be able to handle this.

So we had to get to a new new system The question was, what new system and essentially the fork in the road was, Do we use the federal system or do we build a system for North Carolina? And we decided to build the Cove vaccine management system for North Carolina for a number of reasons, most importantly, so that we could have a system that was tailored to the needs of North Carolina so that we could make enhancements improvements here in North Carolina and most importantly, that we could ultimately link that system into Elektronik health records in our hospitals and other provider sites Because we way know that the faster we can get that data entry in the better the federal system has no plans toe ever do that sort of integration on DSO, we felt like that was enough of a reason In addition, Thio just making the investment here from North Carolina to go with a state system Obviously the system is working We've logged, as I said, over 200 1000 vaccines at the time at this time, but we know it's a new system, so there means training, and that means answering questions on DSO We are hosting all day, every day, office hours to support providers and this and there's a help desk, etcetera I'm sure you I know I've gotten a number of questions, but happy to answer them Azzawi go through there But, um, the I will just continue to say we making improvements to the system all the time to make sure that it is even more user friendly as we go.

The last thing I would say in terms of speed is looking forward to the next number of weeks is thinking about how we can use additional vendors to support us We don't want to just rely on our local health departments and hospitals They're great They're working hard, but they're they've been working hard for 10 months And so how do we supplement that with additional paid vendors? That was always the intent, Aziz We got into a place where they were going to be more vaccine here in the state Okay Excellent Um, I wanted to just talk a bit about how to folks find the answer Thio.

Well, am I Can I get my vaccine now? And if so, where do I get it from? So there's a couple of places that I want folks to know about how to get more information about vaccines So first is our our vaccine website Your spot, your shot that And see that Gov has all that information And I would say again there with us here, because every day we're getting new guidance from the federal government And even today, there may be new guidance about prioritization and others that will have to incorporate into this work We do have, Ah, a 1 800 number that is set up It is not a line that can make appointments directly, but it can direct books to vaccine sites near them, um, to their local health departments or to the hospital systems that are vaccinating And but we are working to stand up I'm or substantial customer service, uh, input at the state level to facilitate this bond.

We're working through that over the next couple of weeks All right, on to the next leg because, um is about addressing equity I'm doing a press conference later this afternoon You will see we're launching yet another P s A That focuses on those who are over 75 getting their shots, but particularly from those from historically marginalized communities We know there was more hesitancy and that those communities as we We're heading into this So this is not a surprised It is something we've been trying to address from the beginning I wanna thank many members of this committee who have partnered with us on connecting with trusted providers with focus on one of the messages But importantly, who are the messengers? We've done hundreds of kind of presentations that teach folks about the vaccine in the hopes that they will then be able to turn around and teach their communities about it s Oh, this is a truly large partnership, Onda We want to bring the voices of trusted messengers to this messenger is so important.

People hearing from those they already trust, um, is going to be so critical And there are many ways on this, and I won't go into all the details on how we're trying to work through this next life Okay, I want to touch on vaccine prioritization, but I want to encourage you to say that we have heard from the federal government I haven't even seen the full release I've just seen a tweet, um, that they are going to be providing us some additional guidance on recommendations But the federal recommendations at this point were provided to us on December 22nd, we those recommendations were come from the CBC's Vaccine Advisory Committee When they were released on the 22nd, we took a look again at our prioritization, and we aligned with that federal guidance, as we want to do on DSO right now, we are in phase one B Group one s So we are continuing to vaccinate those in our one a group meaning our health care providers and those who are long chair from care workers and residents But we have started to vaccinate those who are 75 up Onda again I'll stop there because there may be new information coming from the federal government that we need to integrate.

But let me just go to the next slide just toe help you understand a bit about where that prioritization uh uh, guidance came from we know we're trying to prioritize those folks who are both at highest risk for severe disease or hospitalizations or death, as well as those who are at higher risk for exposure to the virus due to the nature of their job I think we want to very much protect the highest of the high risk Who? Who, if they get this virus, it can be, unfortunately enormously serious and very deadly And the chart you see on the slide here really illustrates that And for us, that cut point really is at at 75 where we see if you are over 75 Um, that represents 60% of our deaths You could see if you open that down to 65 We do get another 20% increase in the deaths But the the vast, vast majority are those who are over 75 Which is why, even as we went into one D, we wanted to make sure those who are over 75 that prioritized first.

You know, there's a limited amount of vaccine and a lot of folks who are over 75 So we really wanted to get them in first as we thought about our that the next bucket, which is frontline essential workers We really wanted to think about those workers who face occupational related risks related to exposure, meaning they can't do their work from home, and often they can't even do that work physically distant Think about the police officer or the child care worker like there's only so much physical distance that you can maintain, and they do is much as they obviously can But so the next next round of prioritization wanted to recognize the fact that there are some jobs there that don't allow you to stay home nor to stay physically distance at all times We also know that those friend line essential workers are disproportionately from historically marginalized Populations on day also have higher rates of chronic diseases So again, I think from an equity perspective, that all made sense So I'm not going to go through the next number of slides here as we flesh out what does essential worker and such mean, because there may be new guidance coming Like I said from the federal government, that is going to instead of moving to frontline essential workers, they go back to saying, Really just prioritized by age.

We need toe review that guidance, go back to our North Carolina Advisory Vaccine Advisory Committee and understand how we're going to integrate that into the work here in North Carolina So let me end their chairman crop Beck Thank you for this opportunity Thio outline where we are happy to take questions And thank you, Madam Secretary Um, first, I have Senator Heist who's asked to be recognized Senator, how's your recognized? Thank you, Madam Chairman Madam Secretary I first want to assault the numbers you put in this presentation, but had something a little different that the C D.

C Is placed on its website I wanted to ask you about the CDC website of this morning shows Nationally, 254 million doses have been shipped to the states and territories Nine million vaccines have been administered That's about 35% not great But, uh, North Carolina, according to the C d with C website, has received 820,000 doses and has administered 212,000 of those doses Uh, that's 26% 2585% on when you compare that to other states.

That would show North Carolina being 48 out of the 50 states in administering the vaccines It is supposedly received from the federal government, uh, doing a little better than Alabama and Georgia Uh, from those compared to every other state in the Union um Why? And I get into how close these numbers are But why are so many other states doing better than us at getting the vaccine administering? Oh, Secretary Cohen Thank you, Senator Highest Thank you for that question Obviously, we all share that sense of urgency, and I'm certainly share your sense of competitiveness to say why Are are we not the best? Because I certainly think as a state, we we have have worked incredibly hard through this pandemic, so I the numbers on the 500 don't quite match with the numbers I share So I'm happy to go back and sort of double check what the numbers you say sounds like the amount of vaccine that will come to us over the course of this week that has been allocated to us but has not yet been shipped to us So remember, there are some lags here, both in what is when the allocation is made and when it ships, we usually receive our shipments on Tuesday and Wednesday so that vaccine will come to us.

So those additional doses you are talking about will only come to us starting today and tomorrow And then that is part of the work that we've been doing to prioritize these high throughput sites that guaranteed to us to say, Hey, we can ramp up If you could give us a certainty of what's coming to us, we're going to do that So they're just getting those doses now So what I would say is, like is Look, I think there are a lot of folks who are doing very well at this, and I applaud them for the work that they're doing and then some that have vaccine sitting on the shelf and that's not acceptable on That's why our team is reaching out to understand What is it that's holding them back? Is it staffing? Um, is it date? Is it just a data leg that we don't understand? What is it that we can help them? We have to prioritize You know, some of what has come up in the last 24 hours is some of our providers were holding back doses because they were worried they weren't going to get a second dose And so we had to continually reassure folks to say no, we're going thio we That allocation is coming from the federal government We can see it in our allocation bank We can't pull it down quite yet.

We can see it's coming Please don't hold back doses for that second dose So there, there I think there are a lot of issues I think, overall for North Carolina are our decision to prioritize every single county To say we wanna have an access point in every county, you know does mean that there are gonna be some counties that are great and some counties that are going to struggle And I think our job But the state is to help those who may be struggling right now to speed up and do faster And that is my commitment to you, Senator Heist on due to the rest of the members is I want to be the best at getting better And I, uh, we're working hard to get there.

Follow up Think again Madam Chairman and Madam Secretary I, um I think that whether it's competitive or not, most of us don't feel that this process has moved a squeak Leah's It could or should have, uh to this point, and we're wanting to deal with it and to follow on that I have a few quotes That came from August 28th of 2019 from Mike Spray Berry, in which he said, We have learned from experience that many local governments like the staff expertise and capacity to administer disaster relief and further said that a lack of a uniformed process can cause inefficiencies Um, the administration had clearly said beforehand, uh, in the disaster relief area that using these county services, whether it's to get out money for home rebuilding and others, was a process that led to inefficiencies that had, ah, lot of challenges going Why, when we chose this method of going back to the counties and I don't know anybody as opposed to saying we have a site, uh, in each of the 100 counties But why did we choose an administrative structure for that? Uh, that was, we knew would be problematic from history and then to turn around and say we didn't provide specific state guidance and others for how to set this up We merely handed over to basically 100 county health departments and hospitals and said, Have fun Secretary Cohen thank thank you for that question So I would say there are a number of health departments that are doing spectacularly well and do not have any vaccine sitting on their shelf.

I call that Arnell called that Robinson, but then there are others that are aren't doing as well and that that is our job in the state to support them in improving But I think for us at the State needed Thio rely on the infrastructure that we have on board in order to prioritize getting vaccine to every part of this state So that was that was a prioritization decision that we made to make sure that on every part of the state was able tohave an access point in that county Now, I think what we're going back to do is making sure they have the support They do have the guidance from us, but I think guidance on words that you said Senator heights is not enough Now we're getting getting very specific with folks to say, What do you need? How can we help you be successful in this Andi? Uh, and we're moving not to those high throughput vaccine sites so that we can get that mix of both geographic diversity and that efficiency that we all way fall Follow up, Senator High spinal follow up, just toe kind of dive it on that just a bit Mawr Um we've known for a while that the vaccine was coming I guess it was the week after the election we finally knew one had been approved.

But the national everything's been saying the vaccines coming since summer, Uh, in this kind of process, um, when did you direct the counties to have a plan for distribution on what was the department's support and helping them develop that plan? Before we got to the point, the vaccine was on our door Secretary Cohen, Thanks for for that So I think, you know, as a state that we were required by the federal government to submit a state vaccine plan back, I believe in the September timeframe But one of the things that's challenging about this right and the vaccine what the first vaccine was approved on December the 15th eso December 15th was the first day that actually I even saw the data about what this vaccine was and who would would be appropriate for at that point, we were actually hearing way we're questioning whether or not it would even be appropriate for people in our population Over the age of 75 there was some concern Which are they gonna have? The immune reaction? What would be the the side effects? Would it confirm unity? All of those questions So I think there were plans put in place Certainly We were working hard on putting up that I T system, which was ready when when vaccine was here We did put plans together, but I think because of the lack of detail of the vaccine itself, and I'm not faulting everyone, I think everyone is looking hard on this and trying to get that vaccine approved right away.

But until literally the day it was approved and looked at by that advisory committee, we didn't even know what populations necessarily might be excluded I'm glad that we're able to give this to the whole the whole of the state and populations I should say over the age of 16 But I do think that accompanied with the fact that we didn't know what the allocation would be It was hard to plan to scale when we weren't told by the federal government How many forces to expect? And on DSO I think as we've matured, our ability to know what's coming I think that has helped us plan is we go more Thank you, Secretary Cohen Next we have Senator Perry and I want to remind those on the web backs I do have Senator Perry, Senator Bergen and Representive Carney But if you would if you would like to be recognized, please enter into the chat box and will recognize you Yeah.

Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam Secretary Uh, thanks for taking some time to be with us today and talk through this I can appreciate that You and your staff are as frustrated as everyone else about the speed of this and that You want to get it out more quickly I don't think that there's there's any doubts among anyone in that regard Uh, you did just mention planning to scale the rollout, and I think that's fantastic on I'm curious about some detail on how you do plan Thio scale the effort because I just did some quick math, and if we did one, you provided 100,000 doses in the last seven days That's about 14,300 per day From a throughput standpoint, I think you would have to quadruple that To have the vaccine out to 70% of the population in six months, you'd have to have about 61,000 doses per day You have to have about 41,000 doses per day.

Thio have 70% And these were just hypothetical numbers, right? I'm trying to understand the scope of this Uh, it would take nine months at 41,000 doses per day to hit 70% of the population, and I realized everyone's not going to take it But what plan do you have? What is the scale that you've projected? How are you? Um, you know, how are you doing? And look, no one has a perfect plan in the beginning I wanna know how we can help I realize you you must continue to evolve this plan You've got to be willing to make changes if you want to change the outcome So could you just walk me through what your plan is to scale and what you think is reasonable from a timeframe Secretary Cohen Senator Perry, I think you're exactly right.

is that way Need to work on scale So the first step of that So the numbers I I shared in terms of 100,000 doses over the last seven days, That's before we stood up any high throughput sites, right? So the first step in scale is to go to 10 high throughput sites on DSO That is what you're going to see just this week and again I think that is just the start And then we're trying to think through, Okay, where is the scale from? From that point forward, Um, now I want I want to say just in terms of numbers, way have about 120,000 doses that come to the state per week 120,000 doses total for this for the escape Now, we do have some of that backlog we need to work through, and we need to ramp up So we need to ramp up beyond even doing 120,000 doses in a week We have to go beyond that.

And then remember, we have to go back for that second dose So I think some of the issue here is also making sure we ramp so that we can get through this backlog get 120,000 doses out every week But then we have to remember we're gonna be doing second doses, So we're actually gonna be doing double that So I think that those that's the that's the math that we're going through right now So we're trying to say Okay, how many high throughput vaccine sites in addition to our providers and at what rate do they need to be going? And if they're not able to step up to that rate, how do we put in a dish? Plug in additional providers, uh, into that space because we are still trying to maintain that geographic distribution across our state So I think that that is the way and I'm happy Thio talk off line I know there's a lot of other questions, but that's exactly the math is like, How do you get to clearing our backlog? Getting through what we get every week, getting the second doses in? I think it's a combination of the high throughput sites as well as our individual vaccine providers Uh, really understanding what is there truth? Put what we want to do is is not necessarily always relying that we're gonna use contracts and inventors It's similar to what we did in testing testing.

We also relied on hospitals and on other providers But then we, as the state came in On top of that, they know there are certain places where we need to use vendors Did you to stand up free community testing events? We're going to see the same thing on DSO That's how the scale will happen over the next number Follow up, Senator Perry Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam Secretary When you the planning of the vaccine distribution, who is the operational control person? Who's the folks? The person the individual running the day to day? Yeah, it is My deputy secretary, Cody Kinsley's are operational lead And then Amanda Fuller more is our vaccine, Leigh, that does all of our interfacing with the federal government and allocations between the two of them Uh, Cody Kinsley, Uh, on the operational side, Amanda Fuller.

More on working with our federal partners and on the allocation But I will say it's a it's an all hands on deck effort I'm I'm certainly have only involved in a in a day as, uh, are almost every member of my team I call a team vaccine and everyone's on it And frankly, we need everyone on it It's all of our hospitals are on Our local health departments are But But that is that for me, that is who my my to go to use on my team on Who are they? That final follow up, Secretary Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam Secretary, I live in the rural part of North Carolina and I represent to rural poor counties and, uh, you know, we we know there's been a lot of publicity about hot spots in some processing facilities in the past and a lot of concerns about spread.

Uh, is there ah, plan in place to use mobile teams or or thio? Get the vaccine in the hands of some of these large employers for them to do their own vaccinations on site How has that been addressed? Of what's in the works? Secretary Cohen Yeah, great question And those are the kinds of partnerships that we're exploring right now And I think you are going way do want to facilitate those particularly certain employers who were gonna be those frontline workers and figuring out how to make that work The wrinkle of some of this is that the vaccine is actually very fragile to move around So we just have to work through the logistics logistics of the planning, making sure the vaccinators air trained But we very much want to get close to where people are, whether that's their worksites or their home as possible It's why we prioritize the geographic distribution E.

I think they're like I said, There's been a lot of folks who come to offer support, offer that partnership And that's what we're teasing through now that put those pieces in place So stay tuned as we work through, uh, more on that But that's exactly the kind of partnerships were looking for Thank you, Senator Bergen Thank you, Madam Chairman Senator Bergen Um, excuse me for interrupting you I just want to remind we have a lot of questions So if you would please keep your questions short as you can.

And Secretary Cohen, if you would keep your your answers as short as possible Thank you Madam Secretary Madam Chairman Good to see I mean, Madam Secretary Always good to see a couple of things Uh, this morning And Benson at 12 o'clock, people started lining up They're going to start giving vaccines at 10 And they're only going to give a 500 vaccines.

So you've got people 75 years old sitting from midnight till 10 o'clock this morning to get a vaccine? Just about three minutes ago I got this Mr Bergen My wife and I went to get our vaccine Today in Sanford, we found that the line of cars was 3 to 4 miles, 3 to 4 miles long We decided we could not wait that long I sense it will only get worse This is no way to treat people 75 Plus, needless to say, I'm very disappointed in our government.

That's Nick Brisard Way got to do better on DWI Gotta figure this out And I'm just curious Um, why do we have, uh, don't Why don't we have just one system? Why are we letting counties do different things? I mean, the people that control the vaccine and that's you should be able to dictate how we do this And I know that that we're all of us are trying to work together, but without a plan, we were going to fail Um, so I guess my questions and I got a bunch of them, and I'm gonna be real fast Madam Chairman is, um is there one system or playing in place with state? Or does the counties have their own system? And how is somebody supposed to sign up to get a vaccine? I don't want 75 year old Plus people waiting all night in a cold car are even starting I don't think it's safe to do this and to be exposed like this So I'd love to hear a great solution to this Secretary Cohen.

Thank you, Senator Bergen So first I would say we sent out guidance thio all of the vaccine providers on best practices And we said specifically, please try to avoid the exact situation that you are referring Thio Now every county is approaching this slightly differently, and some of them are doing a first come first serve, and then you get hours of lines because look, the numbers just don't add up way Like I said, even if we were able to get all the vaccine out today, we have more 75 year olds than have vaccine here in our state So we know that that is not that is not possible on DSO We are asking folks to try to do appointments Um, but I think they are also still working at the efficiencies of those appointments Some folks are like I said, doing a terrific and have I've heard the same and it don't I've had a terrific experience, and I want to shout out to Robinson County because it was the mom of one of my team members who was vaccinated Robertson County yesterday.

No appointment brought It was brought in early Got her vaccine didn't wait It didn't wait Right? So we hear both of those stories Our job, I think, at the state levels to facilitate those, um that that are are struggling to help them figure out How can we do this this better? You know, we do We do know that everyone is doing this slightly different, so there is not one number where someone can go to get an appointment What we're working towards is to be able to take a folks and facilitate that more than we are at the state level right now, but we're not there yet Follow it.

Follow up Thank you Miniature Okay, so let's talk about the counties in, because apparently that's where the problem is because we haven't even talked about hospitals yet But can you just tell me? Number one? Why are we late in the counties use their own system Why didn't we tell them or explain the system and implement it? Because you control the vaccine Secondly, just walk through the nuts and bolts of what you all did to provide the county's information and give them directions on how toe sign people up When did all of that go out to them? So they will know You know, I'd love to see what you send them I'd like to see a copy of what was sent to them, how they do this.

And if if DHHS is expecting multiple sign up plans in different counties generate confusion, why don't we get ahead of that? Because I could see a problem starting if you We've got 85 health departments, I think, and then you take all the hospitals And if you take all of that group and you don't have one plan, and I know we have to be flexible because this is a moving target But but I still see that this this was right for confusion to begin with Thank you, Secretary Cohen Thank you, Senator So a couple of things One We did not think that adding an additional layer of bureaucracy over an appointment system that many particularly many hospitals and many health departments have appointment systems that they've been using for a very long time We didn't feel like adding another layer to this was going to be, uh, something that was ultimately going to be successful So wanting Thio utilize the infrastructure that we have, I would say we do have one shared system in terms of having vaccine tracking across all.

And that is why we built our own CVM Ask over the management system where that is one system where we able to understand what's happening everywhere, and I think that is a real asset to us Andi, I think it will help us improve much more perfectly Follow, follow, find a follow up I actually talked to the department and had them send me the CBMs questions And then the original federal questions, and they're very similar But But it seems like we could have had a system and a lot of 75 olders might have a problem with it, where a lot of this information could be pre filled our pre done So that because I'm hearing that it takes a long time just to get all the information in much like a minute to minute and a half shot And sometimes it's taken 15, 20 minutes to do the paperwork and they were having trouble with it at first So I hope I hope you all confined away toe.

Expedite that and move it alone That's final question Thank you, Secretary Cohen Yes, sir It's one of the reasons why we wanted Thio have that I t system here in North Carolina so we could make those exact enhancement The federal system has no plans Thio, streamline that integration of data between an electronic health record on our system on DSO Yeah, we were not there where I want to be yet, but the fact that we have our own system allows for us to be able to get there over the next number of weeks and so I think that will certainly help with our efficiency as well Thank you, sir Mhm Thank you.

Madam Secretary members were going to deviate for just a minute on We'll come back to you, Secretary Cohen, with more questions We have the senior vice president from CVS, Mr Christopher Cox, on Web backs And I had contacted him to give us an update on on the vaccinations that CVS and Walmart are doing for the nursing homes And he has to jump off in just a few minutes So if it's there, no objections from the committee We will hear from Mr Cox and hear his his comments Mr Cots, you're recognized All right.

Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you Representatives and senators Um, so just to give a quick overview on the program, um, you know, the federal government set this up as an option for states to opt into for CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate both the residents and staff of the long term care facilities North Carolina opted into the program and just under 900 long term care facilities elected CBS as their vaccination partner Uh, the program was set up in two parts part a for skilled nursing facilities and part B for assisted living and all other you know, long term care facilities North Carolina elected to activate both Part A and part B on December 28th And so that is when our clinics in long term care facilities started to date As I mentioned of those just under 900 that selected us, and this is, you know, this is actually through yesterday So the real time information we have conducted about 400 clinics for just over 26,000 vaccinations, and we have almost about another 250 clinics scheduled between now and the end of the week on Sunday The way the program was structured was for the each dose cycle to be administered within either three weeks or four weeks, depending on the product selected as we're using the Modern A vaccine in North Carolina, the cycle is four weeks.

That allows us to get through all of the first doses and then to be able to start the second those clinics right on the heels of completion So I can tell you is we are on track for completion of that four weeks cycles Onda We are now reporting daily into the CDC Tiberius system for both updates to our schedule as well as updates to vaccinations given Let me conclude these brief, prepared remarks by just thanking you for having me and thanking Secretary Cohen and her team for the partnership with CBS Throughout this effort, you know, we share your sense of urgency and getting this important work done on It's been an amazing effort so far on, we're happy to be able to help vaccinate this most vulnerable population Thank you, Mr Cox Any quick questions for Representative White, Mr Cox? Representive white Thank you, Madam Chair.

I have a question regarding, uh, those long term care residents that are in their home The Homestead Act requires home care, a zone option for long term care And I just wondered if the federal government or if CVS or if the state has had any plans to make sure that residents who are being provided long term care in their homes are also able to get this vaccine Mr Cox, Thank you, Representative White So for the program for this federal pharmacy long term care partnership, it does not include home based individuals, but it does include just the facility based individuals However, I wouldn't be able to speak to if there are other plans in place after that Thank you Thank you Mr Cox.

Three chair has a comment The I have had several calls from my long term care facilities that were not scheduled until, like the week of the 28th And they were very concerned because they obviously thought they would be at the front of the line and start on the 21st Um, Mr Cox, do you see that those all of those long term care facilities will be able to receive those vaccinations in a timely manner? What? What do you see? That timeframe? Uh, looking like Yes, ma'am, we do expect to be able to complete all of the first doses, you know, really? Here by the by the end of the month
